A 2-player game where both players use the same button to try and defeat each other.
- A spinning laser in the middle of the screen, at either end of the screen is a reactor/base for each player.
- The laser is only active when the button (spacebar?) is held down.
- The goal is to laser your opponent's base while protecting yours.
- Circular area for the laser, around the outside is traps/powerups that can be lasered to advantage or disadvantage both players at once. This presents a trade-off for the user.
- Players try to swat each others' hands away from the spacebar.
- Maybe have times when they have to work together or they both die.
